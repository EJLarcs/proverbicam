Beauty|is in the eye of the beholder
Beauty|is only skin deep
Birds of a feather|flock together
Blood|is thicker than water
Charity|begins at home
Children|should be seen and not heard

Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man|healthy, wealthy and wise
Every cloud|has a silver lining
Every dog|has its day
Every man|has his price
Every picture|tells a story
Every stick|has two ends
First impressions|are the most lasting
Flattery|will get you nowhere
Give a man enough rope and he|will hang himself
Good things|come to those who wait

In the kingdom of the blind the one eyed man|is king
Laughter|is the best medicine
Life|begins at forty
Life|is like a box of chocolates

One swallow|does not make a summer
One volunteer|is worth ten pressed men
Only fools and horses|work
Patience|is a virtue
People who live in glass houses|shouldn't throw stones
Practice|makes perfect
Prevention|is better than cure
Revenge|is a dish best served cold
Revenge|is sweet
Rome|wasn't built in a day
Silence|is golden
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words|will never hurt me
Take care of the pence and the pounds|will take care of themselves
Talk|is cheap
What doesn't kill you|makes you stronger
The apple|never falls far from the tree
The best defence|is a good offence
The best laid plans|go to waste
The best things in life|are free
The bread|always falls buttered side down
The course of true love|never did run smooth
The customer|is always right
The darkest hour|is just before the dawn
The devil|finds work for idle hands
The early bird|catches the worm
The female of the species|is more deadly than the male
The grass|is always greener on the other side
The hand that rocks the cradle|rules the world
The longest journey|starts with a single step
The opera|isn't over until the fat lady sings
The pen|is mightier than the sword
The proof of the pudding|is in the eating
The road to hell|is paved with good intentions
The way to a man's heart|is through his stomach
Those who do not learn from history|are doomed to repeat it
Those who sleep with dogs|will rise with fleas
Time and tide|wait for no man
Time|is money
Tomorrow|is another day
Tomorrow|never comes
Truth|is stranger than fiction
Two wrongs|don't make a right
Two heads|are better than one
Two is company, but three|is a crowd
Two wrongs|don't make a right
Variety|is the spice of life
The hills|have eyes
The walls|have ears
What goes up|must come down
When the cat's away the mice|will play
When the going gets tough, the tough|get going
Women and children|first
Worrying|never did anyone any good
Youth|is wasted on the young
